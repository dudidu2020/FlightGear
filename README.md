# FlightGear Remote Control App

This project allows the user to connect to the FlightGear app via their Android Smartphone, the user is able to connect to the computer where the FlightGear is running and control the airplane with the joystick and the sliders.

This project uses the MVVM structure, the view (layout file and a Java file) is controlled by the user, using binding the data is sent throw the view model and then to the model to communicate with the server (the commands are sent to a thread that executes the data).

The UML file which represents the connection between the different structures in the project is available via this link: https://github.com/dudidu2020/FlightGear/blob/master/Flight-converted.pdf
